// Complete these one at a time. Test each one several times to make sure it works.
// When you are done with each one, comment it out when you move to the next one, so it doesn't keep showing up.
// 1. Ask the user for a number and print whether it is positive or negative or zero.


// let readline = require("readline-sync");
//
// let number = parseFloat(readline.question("enter any number "));
//
// if (number == 0) {
//   console.log("This number is zero: ");
// } else if (number > 0) {
//   console.log("This number is a positive number: ");
// } else if (number < 0) {
//   console.log("This number is a negative number: ");
// }


// 2. Ask the user to enter three numbers, and then print out the biggest number they entered.


// let readline = require("readline-sync");
//
// let num1 = parseFloat(readline.question("enter the first number: "));
// let num2 = parseFloat(readline.question("enter the second number: "));
// let num3 = parseFloat(readline.question("enter the third number: "));
//
// if (num1 > num2 && num1 > num3) {
//   console.log("The first one was biggest");
// } else if (num1 < num2 && num2 > num3) {
//   console.log("The second one was biggest");
// }else {
//   console.log("The third one was biggest");
// }


// 3. Ask the user for a number and print whether it is odd or even


// let readline = require("readline-sync");
//
// let num = parseFloat(readline.question("enter any number: "));
//
// if ((num % 2) == 0) {
//   console.log("This number is an positive number: ");
// } else if ((num % 2) == 1) {
//   console.log("This number is a odd number: ");
// }


// 4. Ask the user to enter a letter and tell them if it is a vowel or consonant


// let readline = require("readline-sync");
//
// let letter = parseFloat(readline.question("Please enter any number: "));
//
// if(letter == a ) || (letter == e ) || (letter == i) || (letter == o) || (letter == u) {
//   console.log("This number is a vowel: ");
// } else {
//   console.log("This number is a odd number: ");
// }


// 5. Ask the user to enter a year, and tell them if it was a leap year.
// (You can use Google if you're not sure when leap years happen.)

// 6. Ask the user if they have been a citizen for at least 9 years (yes or no), ask them their age, and ask if they live in New York state.
// If they answer yes, their age is above 30, and yes, then tell them they can run for senate in NY. Otherwise, say that they cannot.

// 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a whole number 1-7 and prints out the corresponding day of the week.
// If you want another challenge, look up how to use switch statements and use a switch instead of if-else for this.
// Note that we usually don't bother with switch statements unless there are more than a few elses.
